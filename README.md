**Note:** In part 2, the drawio.png is HUGE. So if it's hard to look at, I've included a smaller version in that dir called `part2_small.png`.

#### Notes for Me
To create a Javascript file: `partX-questionY.js` <br/>
To run the code with Node: `node partX-questionY.js` <br/>
To run commands without a file (command-D to exit): <br/>
```vim
    $ node
    > '3' + 2
    '32'
    >
```
